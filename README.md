# Arc::ToolKit!

Freddy Wordingham's **A**pplying **R**adiation to **C**ancer code: **ARC**!

A systems programming library of useful physics simulation tools.

Work contained here is purely origonal unless otherwise specified in local file documentation.

The arc library forms the backbone of the project and is written purely in Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/. Python3 is the scripting language of choice when forming plots. Zsh is the shell of choice.
